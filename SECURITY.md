# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities 
Security is a critical component of performance testing, especially when dealing with sensitive production endpoints. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not use the public issue tracker.

## Reporting Process 
Please email the maintainer directly. Provide a summary of the vulnerability, the potential impact, and a proof of concept. We aim to acknowledge all reports within 24 to 48 hours and will work with you to provide a fix before public disclosure.

## Scope 
This policy covers all scripts (slt.sh and dlt.sh) and the handling of headers, cookies, and URL data within this repository.
